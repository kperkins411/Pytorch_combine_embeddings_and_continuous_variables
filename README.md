# Pytorch combining embeddings and continuous variables
Convert categorical variables into embeddings and concat them with with continuous variables that serve as input to a fully connected neural net.

Ref: [Justin Johnsons excellent pytorch introduction ](https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples)

This project builds on the above project using examples.  The most interesting one is [  ] (embeddings) since it concatenates both continuous and categorical variables (via embeddings) into an input for a fully connected neural network.
